# @augment-vir/common

`augment-vir` is a collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are things commonly placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory; they don't really have anything in common with each other except that they have almost no dependencies.

This `common` package is for environment-agnostic augments. Everything in here will work in Node.js or the browser with identical results.
